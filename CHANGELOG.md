# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **UI**: Added a session selector with Practice default and Race mode option, plus fixed graph sizing and lowered segment deformation.
- **Simulation**: Replaced target speed model with pedal-based physics, introducing throttle/brake planning around apex speeds.
- **Telemetry**: Extended speed trace to expose pedal inputs and overlay throttle/brake lines on the graph for live feedback.
- **Tuning**: Added a lookahead resolution slider that scales driver anticipation timing in real-time for comparative testing.
